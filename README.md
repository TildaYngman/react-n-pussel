React-n-pussel

This is a sliding puzzle game built with React, TypeScript, CSS.

How to play:
The aim of the game is to put the tiles in a sequence of numbers starting with 1 in the upper left corner and leaving the blank space in the lower right corner.

To move a tile, simply click on it. A tile can only be moved if it is next to the blank space, and it can only be moved in a vertical or horizontal direction.

To start over with a new board, click on the "Shuffle" button to randomly rearrange the tiles and generate a fresh board.

Good luck and have fun!
